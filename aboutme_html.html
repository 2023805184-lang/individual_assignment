		<br>My name is Zainina Qistina and I am a student of Information Management and an aspiring entrepreneur from Malaysia. I believe that growth begins with courage, the courage to start, to learn, and to keep moving forward even when the path feels uncertain.</br>

		<br>I am currently pursuing my studies at UiTM, where I explore how information, technology, and digital systems shape the way organizations function in the modern world. Through my academic journey, I have developed a strong interest in organization, digital management, and creative problem-solving, all of which influence how I approach my work and ideas.</br>

		<br>Beyond academics, I am the founder of Qisnieyna Luxe, a cosmetic brand built from passion, vision, and determination. Starting from a small idea, I learned how to shape a brand identity, understand marketing strategies, and manage the process of building something meaningful from the ground up. For me, this journey is not only about business, but about confidence, self-belief, and empowering women to embrace their individuality.</br>

		<br>Creativity plays an important role in my life. I work as a freelance designer and have experience in basic web development, allowing me to express ideas through visual design and digital platforms. I enjoy creating aesthetic, thoughtful, and purposeful content that reflects both identity and emotion. Each project I take on becomes a learning experience that contributes to my personal and professional growth.</br>

		<br>Throughout my journey, I have learned the value of independence, discipline, and resilience. Balancing studies, creative work, and entrepreneurship has shaped me into someone who is adaptable, driven, and continuously eager to improve. I see challenges as opportunities to grow and redefine my potential.</br>

		<br>Looking ahead, my hope is to continue evolving as a student, a creator, and a future leader. I aspire to build a life rooted in purpose, creativity, and impact, while inspiring other young women to believe in themselves and pursue their dreams with confidence and grace.</br>
